Interactive CU Engineering Map - CSCI 3308


CSCI 3308 – Project Proposal
Due 02/05/15

Who: Steven Tang, Edward Zhu, Andrew Arnopoulos, Brian Gaydon

Title: ICUEM (Interactive CU Engineering Map)

Description: To have an Interactive Map of the Engineering Center available on 
mobile for convenience. We plan on implementing a system to find rooms based on class schedule, room number, CU club locations, and etc. Users will be able to map a route from where they are to the room that they wish to go to. Floor plans and mapping will be available and implemented intuitively. 

Vision Statement: An application for people to actually be able to navigate the Engineering Center without too much hassle/confusion.

Motivation: Even after being students for a few years here, we still don’t know where things are in the EC. It would drastically reduce the time and stress of finding rooms for all occasions.

Risks: GPS system not as reliable as expected. CU not providing blueprints, therefore manual mapping. Not everyone on team has mobile dev experience. Support for multiple platforms may become a hassle. Strategies: Give certain tasks to people who have the viable experience. Find new ways to track a person’s locations, if not, just have a manual pin option, or use WiFi strength. Cross compiling for iOS and Android.
