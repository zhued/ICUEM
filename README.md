# ICUEM
Interactive CU Engineering Map - CSCI 3308

Vision: An application for people to actually be able to navigate the Engineering Center without too much hassle/confusion.

Team Members: Steven Tang, Edward Zhu, Andrew Arnopoulos, Brian Gaydon

Motivation: Even after being students for a few years here, we still donâ€™t know where things are in the EC. It would drastically reduce the time and stress of finding rooms for all occasions.
